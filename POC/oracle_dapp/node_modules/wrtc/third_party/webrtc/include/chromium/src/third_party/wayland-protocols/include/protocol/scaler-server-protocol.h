/**
 * wl_viewport - crop and scale interface to a wl_surface
 * @destroy: remove scaling and cropping from the surface
 * @set: set the crop and scale state
 * @set_source: set the source rectangle for cropping
 * @set_destination: set the surface size for scaling
 *
 * An additional interface to a wl_surface object, which allows the
 * client to specify the cropping and scaling of the surface contents.
 *
 * This interface allows to define the source rectangle (src_x, src_y,
 * src_width, src_height) from where to take the wl_buffer contents, and
 * scale that to destination size (dst_width, dst_height). This state is
 * double-buffered, and is applied on the next wl_surface.commit.
 *
 * The two parts of crop and scale state are independent: the source
 * rectangle, and the destination size. Initially both are unset, that is,
 * no scaling is applied. The whole of the current wl_buffer is used as the
 * source, and the surface size is as defined in wl_surface.attach.
 *
 * If the destination size is set, it causes the surface size to become
 * dst_width, dst_height. The source (rectangle) is scaled to exactly this
 * size. This overrides whatever the attached wl_buffer size is, unless the
 * wl_buffer is NULL. If the wl_buffer is NULL, the surface has no content
 * and therefore no size. Otherwise, the size is always at least 1x1 in
 * surface coordinates.
 *
 * If the source rectangle is set, it defines what area of the wl_buffer is
 * taken as the source. If the source rectangle is set and the destination
 * size is not set, the surface size becomes the source rectangle size
 * rounded up to the nearest integer. If the source size is already exactly
 * integers, this results in cropping without scaling.
 *
 * The coordinate transformations from buffer pixel coordinates up to the
 * surface-local coordinates happen in the following order: 1.
 * buffer_transform (wl_surface.set_buffer_transform) 2. buffer_scale
 * (wl_surface.set_buffer_scale) 3. crop and scale (wl_viewport.set*) This
 * means, that the source rectangle coordinates of crop and scale are given
 * in the coordinates after the buffer transform and scale, i.e. in the
 * coordinates that would be the surface-local coordinates if the crop and
 * scale was not applied.
 *
 * If the source rectangle is partially or completely outside of the
 * wl_buffer, then the surface contents are undefined (not void), and the
 * surface size is still dst_width, dst_height.
 *
 * The x, y arguments of wl_surface.attach are applied as normal to the
 * surface. They indicate how many pixels to remove from the surface size
 * from the left and the top. In other words, they are still in the
 * surface-local coordinate system, just like dst_width and dst_height are.
 *
 * If the wl_surface associated with the wl_viewport is destroyed, the
 * wl_viewport object becomes inert.
 *
 * If the wl_viewport object is destroyed, the crop and scale state is
 * removed from the wl_surface. The change will be applied on the next
 * wl_surface.commit.
